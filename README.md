CNC_ShieldBoX
===========================
_PLEASE NOTE_: **you have to work out the tolerances for this design before 3D printing, however if you print it "as is" you may need to use a sanding file to fit all the parts toguether.**

This is a 3D printable box created to house an Arduino Uno form factor and a CNC Shield.

Status

This is still a work in progress.
For now it only supports Arduino uno form factor but I am planning to add Arduino Mega and other boards in the future.
The design was made using openScad.

Usage

You can personalize:

-The size of the height, width of the walls.

-Whether  you want a logo(*.dfx imported to openScad).

-Size of the fan's screws.

-Size of the screws used on the assembly.
